Welcome to NorESM documentation!
================================================

The purpose of the norESM documentation is to provide a common place for NorESM users and developers to share information. How is the code organised? What tools are you using? Which version should I run for what purpose? etc.


This is the NorESM2 documentation which is currently being re-organized, under revision.

| The corresponding NorESM2 ReadTheDocs can be found here
| https://noresm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/noresm2/

If you have any questions or interested in actively participate in the reorganization, create a new issue on github at https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM/issues
